## Writing a Simple Prompt

To create a simple prompt for your agent, you can write it in a file called `PROMPT.txt` in the same directory the agent is initialized. This file will contain the text that guides the behavior of your agent. For example, you might want your agent to act as a helpful assistant. Here is how you can write a simple prompt:

1. Create a file named `PROMPT.txt` in your project directory.
2. Write your prompt text in the file. For example:

```
You are a helpful assistant.
```
